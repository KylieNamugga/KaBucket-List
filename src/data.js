    description:'East or west, home is best, so why not start the money eating adventure in my home country? I have always wanted to go on Safari with my mister. The first time I went was with my friends and I could not stop wishing he was there to enjoy all the beauty with me. In 2023 I intend to share nature and all it has to offer with him. I intend to book us into the luxurious Mweya Safari Lodge.',

    description:'Do not take my word for it but from the 100001 youtube videos I have watched, Thailand seems like such a beautiful place to explore with so many beautiful islands hidden away from the ever Vibrant Bangkok. I would love to explore the southern Islands, who better to take than my best friend? We will be busy judging you all from Paradise. ',

    description:'This may seem so far pout of our comfort zones ( I heard mbu black people do not ski) but listen, if there is one thing I would like to do before I die then this is it. First all the cold does not bother me, I Love cold places and I have always wanted to speed through the snow like all the people in the movies I have watched. Will it be the same thing? Simanyi but we will have so many stories for you when we get back. ',

    description:'I do not think my mister is really keen on this one. He believes humans should stay on land where they are meant to be, leave the seas and oceans alone. Funny thing is of the two of us, he is the only one who can swim (I on the other hand will survive on the strength of Jesus and love of Allah). I am looking forward to this though, maybe I will find my own Nemo. It is worth a try in my books. ',

    description:'This last activity is a little selfish to be honest. The desire for authentic korean BBQ has been fuelled by all the k-dramas I have watched over the last 3 years, but, If I am to go into a food coma then who better to have around than the person who can carry me? I would have chosen Auma, Leah and Olive for this trip but I can see them looking at me harshly as I float off to foreign heaven. I am not taking any chances. FOOD MUST BE EATEN! ',
